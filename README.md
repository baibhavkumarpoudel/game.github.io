## Goals to achieve:
- Design a fun trivia quiz which prompts the user with a final score 

## Technology used
- VSCode (HTML, CSS, JS), CMD, GitHub Enterprise 

## Approach
- Typical planning to submit by Friday
- Monday: work on HTML and begin to modify the classes,IDs, and tags in CSS. Publish site
- Tuesday: get HTML portion wrapped out and focus of designing the website (CSS)
- Wednesday: work on animations and manipulations for the page through JS
- Thursday: Modify anything that i think has potential for improvement, practice presentation

## user pov
- Lay out the questions on the page as a highschool class quiz format
- Once the user is done choosing answers, a function will calculate the score and present it
- Have an eye-catching design through the utlization of css
- Once the answers are submitted, user clicks the submit button
- Once the questions have individual answers picked, the submit click gives score as an output 
- Once user hits sumbmit, the final score should appear (out of 100%)

## How i solved the ultimate challenge

- utlized if statement inside a function containing 2 parameters (answer, array) to compare user answers to right answers. Lastly, I used querySelector to select 'percentage' class to manipulate it 

## things I could've done better

- color coded the wrong & right answers after the submit click
- Learn more about scrollTo()
- keep it DRY for value selection
