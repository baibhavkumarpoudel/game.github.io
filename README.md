//Goals to achieve:
Design a fun trivia quiz which prompts the user with a final score 

//Technology used
VSCode (HTML, CSS, JS)

//Approach
Typical planning to submit by Friday
-Monday: work on HTML and slowly begin to modify the classes,IDs, and tags in CSS
-Tuesday: get HTML portion wrapped out and focus of designing the website
-Wednesday: work on animations for the page through JS
-Thursday: Modify anything that i think has potential for improvement, practice presentation

//User pov
-Lay out the questions on the page as a highschool class quiz format
-Once the user is done choosing answers, a function will calculate the score and present it
-Have an eye-catching design through the utlization of css
-Once the questions are submitted, user can't change the answers 
-Once all the questions have individual answers picked, the submit button is accessible 
-Once user hits sumbmit, the final score should appear (out of 100%)
